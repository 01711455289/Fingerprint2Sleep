# Fingerprint to Sleep

Sleep your device via fingerprint sensor. Currently, it only works
well on MIUI, in other systems it will cause the fingerprint to
unlock doesn't work.

## Tips

1. If you Boot Manager app, please allow `Fingerprint to Sleep` autostart.
On MIUI, go to `Security`→`Permissions`→`Autostart`, and choose `Fingerprint to Sleep`.
2. If you use Task Management app, please add `Fingerprint to Sleep` to whitelist.
On MIUI, go to `Settings`→`Battery & performance`→`Manager apps battery usage`
→`Choose apps`→`Fingerprint to Sleep`, and choose `No restriction`.
